# Enhancing banana production

### Objective
For this data analysis project, I analyzed the variables that correlate with the "sweetness" of the harvested bananas, intending to find data to improve the production of bananas with greater sweetness and, if possible, in a shorter amount of time.

### After realizing the analysis, it was found out that:

1. There is a medium correlation between the sweetness and the weight of the fruit of 0.42, which suggests that the sweetness that the fruit will obtain according to its weight can be indicated to a certain extent.
2. There is no other variable apart from the weight that has a significant relationship with the sweetness (target variable) of the fruit according to the Pearson method.
3. Although there is a medium correlation between the sweetness and the weight of the banana, this does not necessarily mean causality, so this correlation should be explored further. For this reason, it is recommended to develop experiments to change the weight of the fruit and in this way determine if the desired changes in the sweetness of the fruit are generated.
